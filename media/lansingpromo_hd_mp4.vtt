00:00:06.708-->00:00:08.089
[SCARY TONE!]

00:00:19.377-->00:00:23.995
Lansing has been called by many, "Technically the capital of Michigan."

00:00:23.995-->00:00:29.028
But there's more to our city than the government workers who flee the city boundaries promptly at 5:01.

00:00:29.054-->00:00:33.658
Yes, that's right. Lansing residents - or Lanstranauts as they like to be called -

00:00:33.663-->00:00:39.559
spend time each year touring the scenic, and baffling parking lots of Horrocks and Frandor.

00:00:39.559-->00:00:45.304
[Car horn honking] AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHGGGGGHHHH

00:00:45.322-->00:00:49.312
Lansing has the unique distinction of leading the nation in "Things that are other things."

00:00:49.312-->00:00:54.608
A cell phone shop, that's also a barbecue restaurant. A gas station, that's a Cuban sandwich place.

00:00:54.775-->00:01:02.119
A liquor store, that's also a laundromat. A baseball stadium that's also a soccer stadium.

00:01:02.119-->00:01:09.206
A porn shop, that's also a psychic parlor. And by 2025: A city that's also a hospital!

00:01:09.225-->00:01:16.204
[Magical sounds of Sparrow taking over the city]

00:01:16.204-->00:01:23.469
How do I get out of here? Six hours... I've got to figure something out.

00:01:23.469-->00:01:29.813
For those looking to make a home in Lansing, there are many vibrant neighborhoods to choose from.

00:01:29.824-->00:01:37.741
Like the Eastside, it's got a restaurant now. Or downtown, a great place to get a sandwich... before 4:00 PM.

00:01:37.783-->00:01:45.929
Or REO Town, home to one business per power plant. Old Town, like REO Town, but for Chase Sapphire members.

00:01:45.929-->00:01:50.998
South Lansing, home to the world's premier Fast Food Architectural Preserve.

00:01:51.015-->00:01:59.390
Whether you're looking to live. Work. Play. Just blast the Speedwagon.

00:01:59.414-->00:02:08.450
[REO Speedwagon's "Keep on Loving you" blares from car speakers]

00:02:08.450-->00:02:18.523
Lansing is a city that's gonna keep on loving you. It's 5:15... so....

00:02:18.523-->00:02:28.027
